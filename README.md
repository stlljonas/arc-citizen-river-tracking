First run the following command to install any required packages you might be missing:

`$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Now you can visualize the data. Run:

`$ python3 airtable-activity-graph.py`

The generated files will automatically be saved in this directory. In case you don't like the scaling, change the window size of the plot when it pops up after running the script and when you're happy, save it manually in your preferred location.
